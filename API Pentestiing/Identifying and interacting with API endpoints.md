# Identifying API endpoints
You can use Burp Scanner to crawl the application, then manually investigate interesting attack surface using Burp's browser.
While browsing the application, look for patterns that suggest API endpoints in the URL structure, such as ```/api/```. Also look out for JavaScript files.

# Interacting with API endpoints
Once you've identified API endpoints, interact with them using Burp Repeater and Burp Intruder. For example, you could investigate how the API responds to changing the HTTP method and media type.

Review error messages and other responses closely. Sometimes these include information that you can use to construct a valid HTTP request.

# Identifying supported HTTP methods
The HTTP method specifies the action to be performed on a resource. For example:
```
GET - Retrieves data from a resource.
PATCH - Applies partial changes to a resource.
OPTIONS - Retrieves information on the types of request methods that can be used on a resource.
```
An API endpoint may support different HTTP methods so, it's therefore important to test all potential methods.

For example, the endpoint ```/api/tasks``` may support the following methods:
```
GET /api/tasks - Retrieves a list of tasks.
POST /api/tasks - Creates a new task.
DELETE /api/tasks/1 - Deletes a task.
```
You can use the built-in HTTP verbs list in Burp Intruder to automatically cycle through a range of methods.

# Identifying supported content types
API endpoints often expect data in a specific format. They may therefore behave differently depending on the content type of the data provided in a request. 

Changing the content type may enable you to:

- Trigger errors that disclose useful information.
- Bypass flawed defenses.
- Take advantage of differences in processing logic.

For example, an API may be secure when handling JSON data but susceptible to injection attacks when dealing with XML.
To change the content type, modify the ```Content-Type``` header, then reformat the request body accordingly. 
You can use the Content type converter BApp to automatically convert data submitted within requests between XML and JSON.
