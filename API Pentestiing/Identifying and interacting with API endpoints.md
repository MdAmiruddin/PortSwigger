# Identifying API endpoints
You can use Burp Scanner to crawl the application, then manually investigate interesting attack surface using Burp's browser.
While browsing the application, look for patterns that suggest API endpoints in the URL structure, such as ```/api/```. Also look out for JavaScript files.

# Interacting with API endpoints
Once you've identified API endpoints, interact with them using Burp Repeater and Burp Intruder. For example, you could investigate how the API responds to changing the HTTP method and media type.

Review error messages and other responses closely. Sometimes these include information that you can use to construct a valid HTTP request.

# Identifying supported HTTP methods
The HTTP method specifies the action to be performed on a resource. For example:
```
GET - Retrieves data from a resource.
PATCH - Applies partial changes to a resource.
OPTIONS - Retrieves information on the types of request methods that can be used on a resource.
```
An API endpoint may support different HTTP methods so, it's therefore important to test all potential methods.

For example, the endpoint ```/api/tasks``` may support the following methods:
```
GET /api/tasks - Retrieves a list of tasks.
POST /api/tasks - Creates a new task.
DELETE /api/tasks/1 - Deletes a task.
```
You can use the built-in HTTP verbs list in Burp Intruder to automatically cycle through a range of methods.
