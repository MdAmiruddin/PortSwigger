# Discovering API documentation

To do this, you can use Burp Scanner to crawl the API. Look for endpoints that may refer to API documentation, for example:
```
/api
/swagger/index.html
/openapi.json
```
If you identify the resource endpoint /api/swagger/v1/users/123, then you should investigate the following paths:
```
/api/swagger/v1
/api/swagger
/api
```
